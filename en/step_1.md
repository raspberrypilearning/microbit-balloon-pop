title: What you will need

---
* 1 x Solderless breadboard
* 1 x 9V battery
* 1 x Battery snap
* 2 x Crocodile clips

For each balloon:
* 3 x pin-to-pin jumper lead
* 1 x 2m strip of 2-core speaker cable
* 1 x BC635 transistor
* 1 x 12Ω resistor

title: What you will do

---
- Wire up a circuit
- Use transistors
- Use a push button to control current
- Use code to control a GPIO pin, to heat up a resistor enough to pop a balloon!
