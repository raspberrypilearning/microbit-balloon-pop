This example uses a Raspberry Pi as the controller, but you will use a micro:bit.

title: Safety note

---

In this project, you will heat a 12Ω resistor so that it pops a balloon.

- Do not touch the resistor when the circuit is triggered. It will get VERY hot.
- The transistor may also get hot.
- The balloon will make a loud noise when it pops, which may be distressing for some people.

title: What you will need

---
* 1 x Solderless breadboard
* 1 x 9V battery
* 1 x Battery snap
* 2 x Crocodile clips
* Some electrical tape
* Some string and sticky tape or Blu Tack

For each balloon:
* 3 x Pin-to-pin jumper lead
* 1 x 2m strip of 2-core speaker cable
* 1 x BC635 transistor
* 1 x 12Ω resistor

title: What you will do

---
- Wire up a circuit
- Use transistors
- Use a push button to control current
- Use code to control a GPIO pin, to heat up a resistor enough to pop a balloon!
