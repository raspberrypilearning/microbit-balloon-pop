## What can I do now?

You could change the trigger from Button A to another button, a temperature, a gesture (like shake), or even trigger the pop using a radio message received from a second micro:bit!

If you want to have more fun exploring micro:bit, then you could try out any of [these projects](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects?hardware%5B%5D=microbit).
